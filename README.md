# pySSG (python Static Site Generator)
A python based static site generator

pySSG takes the content of your *"content/"*-folder and generates a static website with the layout of your *default.html*, which is stored in *"templates/"*

At the moment "pySSG" is Linux exclusive only, but a cross-plattform support is planned.

It can:
* generate a structure with the files of your *"content/"*-folder
* generate a navigation and subnavigation
* read and generate *.html*- and *.php*-files
* use stylesheets

Usage:
 1. Download
 2. Read the short brief *"web/index.html"*
 3. Edit content, template and files for your needs
 4. Run ./build.sh in terminal
 5. Upload your newly created Website from "web/"-folder
