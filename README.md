# pySSG (python Static Site Generator)
A python based static site generator

pySSG takes the content of your *"content/"*-folder and generates a static website with the layout of your *default.html*, which is stored in *"templates/"*

It can:
* generate a structure with the files of your *"content/"*-folder
* generate a navigation and subnavigation
* read and generate *.html*- and *.php*-files
* use stylesheets
